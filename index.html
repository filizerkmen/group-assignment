                    <p>Given that Little Waves roasts to balance, sweetness, and fullness of flavor, we encourage your enjoyment of any of our coffees on any brew method. 
    
                        Your best bet is thinking about the flavors you enjoy in coffee, then choosing an offering that reflects your preferred gustatory experience. </p>

                <button class="accordion-button">What does speciality-grade mean?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>As a progressive roaster focusing on quality we use the phrase 'speciality coffee' to mean coffees that have scored 80+ according to the Speciality Coffee Association and Coffee Quality Institute coffee grading standards.
    
                        We look to purchase coffees that score of 82+ and in most cases 85+. From a taste point of view, there is a significant difference between a coffee that scores 80 and one that scores 85.
                        
                        Generally speaking, coffees that score higher have more complexity. Another reason why we buy speciality-grade coffee is because this allows coffee producers to earn a significant premium for the high quality coffee that they produce.</p>

                <button class="accordion-button">Is caffeine bad for you?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Like most things, caffeine is absolutely fine if consumed in moderation. However, there are a couple of side-effects if you do drink too much coffee.
                        
                        For example, you may have experienced a caffeine-induced energy crash. This can occur 25 minutes to a couple hours after youâ€™ve consumed coffee or tea.
                        
                        It makes you feel extremely tired and sleepy, irritable, and unable to concentrate. Sometimes it can even feel a bit like a hangover due to nausea and headaches.
                        
                        We have a blog post about how to avoid energy crashes from coffee if this is something that you'd like to stop experiencing.
                        
                        We also have a great blog post all about caffeine, including more about its potential effects and how best to avoid them.</p>
